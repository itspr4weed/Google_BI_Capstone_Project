# Google BI Capstone – Cyclistic

## Overview
This project is my **capstone for the Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate**.  
The goal is to help **Cyclistic** understand how bicycles are used across New York City by finding insights from trip patterns across bike stations, demand, biker behaviour, and congestion at each bike station.
And these insights will support the data-driven business plan and potential expansion of bike stations in high-demand areas across New York City.
